                <p class="text-justify">
                While studying Meaning and Forms of HCI course, our main focus was to understand Contextual Design process. Our team approached IUPUI Library UX team to find out a problem space that we can pick for this project. They suggested working on this problem of Open Journal System which the Journal Managers, Editors, Reviewers, Authors and Readers use. We got into contact with people who use and maintain the Open Access Journal System (OJS) run by the IUPUI Library. The OJS is an online academic journal management system that enables faculty and professors to freely publish and distribute academic journals, as well as engage with peer reviewers and article authors. The OJS also provides an interface for the general public to freely access any journal (and articles) hosted on it.

                Contextual Inquiries revealed to us:
                <ul>
                <li>
                The editors we inquired with were the biggest fountain of inspiration as they use the OJS on an almost daily basis and have been doing so for several years. One of the biggest problems that the editors face is keeping track of what stage of the review/edit process a manuscript is in and what users are involved at the stage and time. The perceived failure of the system to properly address this need has led them to devise a custom paper/spreadsheet method. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Another issue that our inquiries with editors revealed to us is that a lot of coordination between editors, authors, and reviewers is needed in order for the journal publication process to run smoothly. We learned that sometimes their communications protocols have broken down and they have inadvertently sent misleading and contradictory messages. 
                </li>
                <li>Although readers have a limited interaction with the system, they are quite important because if no one reads the journals, all the work everyone else does is for naught. The most important issue both readers faced was getting to the full text PDF of the articles they wanted to read. </li>

                 This phase consisted of Affinity Diagramming session to make sense of the interview data, ideation and visioning workshop. In the ideation phase, total 70 ideas were generated. Each team member contributed to 20 and 10 ideas were taken by an outside team member who has fair idea of the problem space; however, not involved in the other design phases.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                Based on affinity diagrams and ideation phase, one main issue came forward which was having a system that tracks the status of each Journal and visually help them identify the progress of it. This inspired us to using a Kanban style Dashboard. Part of the inspiration for using a Kanban comes from a contextual inquiry session with an OJS assistant editor when she complained that the system provided very little “visual segregation of the status of each article”. This instigated the thought of using agile scrum tool “Storyboard” (which is a bit different than Storyboards in a UX design context). Also, this idea was championed by a member of the team who has successfully used this methodology over many years of work experience.

                In validating and getting feedback from our intended users, we conducted three usability evaluations with a journal manager and two editors who use the existing OJS and were involved with our contextual inquiries. These evaluations followed a think-aloud protocol where the evaluators expressed their opinions and frustrations as they walked through the prototype.
                The editors provided a wealth of feedback and were exceedingly pleased with the prototype, which is understandable considering the state of the current OJS. They also made several feature requests that we might take into consideration moving forward.

                    From our usability evaluations and chats with our users, we feel that it would be wise to refine our prototype and incorporate the changes that they suggested before continuing in the design process. We intend to take a hard look at the Kanban dashboard and reevaluate its usefulness because while it provides neat buckets to place the manuscripts, it appears to provide an affordance that is not supported.
                    Looking forward, we would recommend further prototyping and usability evaluations with editors to improve the design before commencing development. In fact, we do not recommend development until feedback from the editors start to change from fixes to new features, which would happen when they start to dream up new actions the improved design can afford them.
                    Also, keeping in mind that the system only works when authors, journal manager, readers, reviewers, and editors work together, we recommend using the prototype as a proof of concept to get other stakeholders at other journals involved so that design on other components of the system for non-editor roles can be commence.
