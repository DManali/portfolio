                <p class="text-justify">
                Moral Distress occurs when an individualâ€™s moral integrity is seriously compromised, either because one feels unable to act in accordance with core values and obligations, or attempted actions fail to achieve the desired outcome. Dr. Lucia aims in providing a healthy environment where critical care nurses make their optimal contributions to patients and families. In this attempt, they are looking to develop a solution which will enable the nurses to record the level of distress they have been experiencing during the past week. There are many contributing factors to this feeling of Moral Distress such as Clinical Triggers, Internal Factors, Communication and Interpersonal issues, Institutional and Environmental factors, Legal and Regulatory factors etc.
                Dr. Lucia Wocial, an Ethicist Nurse Researcher, is mentoring us on the project. Her research combines ethics and distress amongst the nurse community and studies their implications on the behavior. Our initial meetings with her shaped our understanding of the problem space. To dig more, we reviewed more research papers that Dr. Lucia provided us and we reviewed a few on our own to understand where the technology stand in helping address the stress issues.

                 Meetings with Dr. Lucia and the literature review done in the initial phase gave us the business requirements. On the basis of that, we designed our interview sessions. This was a phase of discovery for us as a team. We decided to go with semistructured interviews along with a survey to gather usage of technology and what are the major contributing factors towards Moral Distress. Also, one of the question we deliberately added to the survey was to understand if the nurses are willing to share their experience with others. We were taken aback by their experiences when they felt moral distress. How much pain they go through on some of the days and we are so ignorant about it. Some of the insights that we got from this data gathering technique were quite surprising and completely opposite to Dr. Lucia's research:

                 We conducted Affinity Diagramming session to make sense of the interview data. It gave us different categories for Nurse and Nurse Manager profile separately. e.g. For Nurse Persona, we found out the reasons for Moral Distress, ways to cope up with it, concerns they have. Similarly for Nurse Manager Persona, how do the Nurse Managers identify if a nurse is experiencing Moral Distress and not just stress, how do they address or provide help to nurses so that they can cope up with it. Even Nurse Managers had concerns for the tools to cope up or record. They had great suggestions for us on how they want to see the aggregate score of moral distress in a particular unit. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                Next step was to create a model which will lead us to our three concepts of problem solution. We chose mental model diagramming to understand our users' motivation to use the system or app. What do they presently do when they experience Moral Distress, what are the different hurdles they face, how system helps them cope up with it. It guided us to our three concepts of solutions to the problem. It gave us the direction in visioning our solution.

                After interating over our low-fidelity prototypes, we included all the suggestions that we received from the stakeholders. We created workflow and we realized that there are a few screens that need to be included. We included everything in out high-fidelity prototype created with Axure RP. This is still work in progress. We will soon be evaluating our prototype to get feedback on our designs from Nurses.
                Dr. Lucia is curious to know the cost involved in developing the prototype into a product. It is a great opportunity for us as students to work on the estimates, so we know what exactly happens in the real world when we design.

                As the AACN 4 A's Model suggests we assess and ask them to act on it. So we suggested them to take up a few intervention strategies of 5 minutes each e.g. Meditation, Adult coloring etc. We again take the feedback from them if they feel any better at that moment after taking up the activity. If not we ask them if they would like to take up any other activity and navigate them accordingly. If not we suggest them to talk to someone and suggest a list of appropriate people to talk to. If they choose one from the list, we open up a channel to chat with that person.

With other participants we condcuted test on the refined prototype. We asked them to rate the app based on the Intuitiveness and Appearance for each feature. The results proved that we need very little improvements in the interactions and content. Some workflows will be improved based on Dr. Wocial's inputs.
